## **Customization**

### Resizing Images
Images are resized using the `height` attribute in HTML to maintain simplicity. For example:
```html
<img src="images/gallery/anime thumbs/Bocchi_The_Rock!.jpg" height="300px" alt="" />
```
To maintain aspect ratio dynamically, consider using CSS:
```css
img {
  max-height: 300px;
  width: auto;
}
```

### Adding New Sections
To add a new section:
1. Copy an existing `<section>` block from `index.html`.
2. Update the header and content as needed.
